# Mobile Dev App
# I have a bug. Whenever I press edit or delete key, it falls under the scope of the whole item and along with the edit/delete function, the state is also changed.
# Details page doesn't contain the values since I could not get enough time to figure it out. I was able to implement the ui-router just today.
#Everything else should be working.
